Digit recognizer neural network made for [this](kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

As the name suggests, it can recognize hand written digits.

## Version 1
A very simple neural network that has 1 hidden layer. Uses mini-batch gradient descent and ReLU for activation.

[networks](version1/networks), a folder with a few models. Just me experimenting with parameters.

## Version 2
An improved neural network that allows for more intuitive use and the addition of more layers with different activation functions.

## Version 3
Work in progress...
